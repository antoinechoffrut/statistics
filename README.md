# Fundamentals of statistics

This repository collects `jupyter` notebooks, often very short,
illustrating fundamental facts and concepts in probability theory and
statistics.

Topics currently include:  
- probability functions (PDF, CDF, etc.)  
- linear regression  
- classification with logisitic regression (with visualization using
  "fuzzy" decision boundaries)  
- bootstrapping  
- error bars  
- hypothesis testing (Student's t-test, Welch's t-test) and p-values
